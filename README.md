## Why jiracli

Most Jira CLIs are wrappers around the REST API that return raw JSON, leaving you to write `jq` pipelines for every query. jiracli takes the opposite approach:

- **Human-readable by default.** Plain text with a consistent structure — status, activity, links, children — rendered in one command.
- **`--json` for scripts.** Every command has a stable NDJSON output (one object per line) with a v1 schema contract. No silent breaking changes.
- **Built for agents.** Every output is context-window-safe: results over ~200 lines are automatically truncated to a temp file, with ready-to-run `grep`/`tail` commands in the output. Pagination surfaces as copy-paste commands, not page numbers to guess.
- **Dry-run by default on all writes.** Every mutation shows the exact HTTP request, a validation block, and the effect — before touching anything. Pass `--yes` to apply.
- **Cached metadata.** Components, versions, priorities, fields, and link types are cached locally (5 min to 24 h TTLs), so repeated lookups are instant and writes validate without extra round-trips.

## Install

### Homebrew (recommended)

```sh
brew tap cgrossde/tap
brew trust cgrossde/tap
brew install jiracli
```

Homebrew installs the binary to `/opt/homebrew/bin` and wires up shell completions automatically. Run `brew upgrade jiracli` (or `brew upgrade`) to get new versions.

### Go install

```sh
go install github.com/cgrossde/jiracli@latest
```

Requires Go 1.21+. The binary lands in `$GOPATH/bin` (usually `~/.go/bin` or `~/go/bin`) — make sure that's on your `$PATH`.

### Build from source

```sh
git clone git@github.com:cgrossde/jiracli.git
cd jiracli
go build -o jiracli .
```

Authenticates with a **Jira Personal Access Token (PAT)**; credentials are stored in the macOS system Keychain — no config files with tokens in plaintext.

## Setup

```sh
jiracli setup
```

The interactive wizard prompts for your Jira server URL and a Personal Access Token, verifies both, and optionally installs the embedded Claude skill. Takes about 30 seconds.

Non-interactive / CI:

```sh
JIRACLI_PAT=<token> jiracli auth login --url https://jira.example.com
```

Verify it worked:

```sh
jiracli auth status
```

## Usage

### Reading issues

```sh
jiracli show PROJ-123                          # full issue with activity (inlines latest comment)
jiracli show PROJ-123 --no-history             # skip changelog
jiracli show PROJ-123 --no-comments            # skip the comment preview
jiracli show PROJ-123 --fields "description"  # add description to the default view

jiracli show comments PROJ-123                 # full comment thread
jiracli show history PROJ-123 --since 7d       # changelog, last 7 days
jiracli show transitions PROJ-123              # what statuses are available next
jiracli show attachments PROJ-123              # list attachments
jiracli show PROJ-123:attach:10042 -o          # stream attachment to stdout
```

### Worklogs

Worklog reads use complete issue worklogs rather than issue `timespent` aggregates:

```sh
jiracli worklog latest                         # newest entry by entered time (created)
jiracli worklog list --since 4w                # entries by work date (started), rolling 28 days
jiracli worklog summary --since 4w --group-by issue
jiracli show worklogs PROJ-123 --author me     # issue-scoped entries
```

Grouped summaries render as an aligned table with entry counts and aggregate Jira durations:

```text
Worklog summary for Alex Chen
Period:   2026-08-24 → 2026-09-21 (rolling 28 days)
Based on: work date

Issue       Entries  Time
ACME-123          4    1w
ACME-124          2    2w
─────────────────────────
Total             6    3w
```

`--since` and `--until` are inclusive; timestamps can be RFC3339, a UTC date, or positive `Nw`, `Nd`, and `Nh` values. Top-level commands default to the authenticated user; `show worklogs` defaults to all visible authors. Use `--issue` or `--project` to narrow a top-level command, and `--all-issues` to bypass the 500-candidate issue safety cap. `--json` emits worklog records or one summary object as NDJSON; aggregate seconds remain available alongside human-readable durations. `show` advertises `show worklogs <KEY>` only when fetched time tracking reports positive spent time. Requesting `worklog` through `show --fields` or `--fields-only` succeeds, embeds no worklog entries, and emits a redirect warning.

### Searching

```sh
jiracli show assigned                                        # open issues assigned to you
jiracli show assigned --state in-progress                    # narrow by status category

jiracli search "project = PROJ AND priority = High"
jiracli search "project = PROJ" --assigned --limit 20
jiracli search "project = PROJ AND issuetype = Bug" --state done
```

The effective JQL is echoed on the first line. The default filter excludes `Done` issues — pass `--include-done` to lift it.

### Hierarchy & effort

```sh
jiracli hierarchy PROJ-123                # where does this sit? (Story → Epic → Initiative)
jiracli hierarchy PROJ-50 --depth 2       # everything under an Initiative/Epic, two levels deep
jiracli hierarchy PROJ-50 --flat          # tabular output instead of a tree

jiracli effort PROJ-50                    # roll up planned/remaining/spent time + story points across children
jiracli effort PROJ-50 --list             # + a per-child table (how much was logged on each Epic)
jiracli effort jql 'sprint = 2001' --group-by assignee
jiracli effort sprint 2001 --group-by status
```

`hierarchy` walks an issue both up the parent chain and down through its descendants; `effort` aggregates time and Story Points over the same children (or over an arbitrary JQL/sprint result set). See [`docs/hierarchy.md`](docs/hierarchy.md) and [`docs/effort.md`](docs/effort.md).

### Writing (dry-run by default)

```sh
# Preview first (no --yes)
jiracli edit status   PROJ-123 "In Review"
jiracli edit assignee PROJ-123 me
jiracli edit field    PROJ-123 "priority=High" "labels+=regression"
jiracli add comment   PROJ-123 "Reproduced on v10.5, not v10.6."
jiracli add link      PROJ-123 PROJ-456 --type Required

# Apply
jiracli edit status PROJ-123 "In Review" --yes
```

Every dry-run shows:
```
DRY RUN — no changes made.

POST https://jira.example.com/rest/api/2/issue/PROJ-123/transitions

Body:
  { "transition": { "id": "31" } }

Effect:
  PROJ-123: In Progress → In Review

Validation:
  ✓ transition 31 "In Review" is available on PROJ-123

Apply with: re-run with --yes
```

### Creating issues

```sh
# Inline
jiracli create --project PROJ --type Bug --summary "Login fails on iOS" --assignee me --yes
jiracli create --project PROJ --type Story --summary "Add OAuth flow" --epic PROJ-100 --yes

# Draft workflow (recommended for complex issues)
jiracli create --init-draft new-issue.yaml   # writes a YAML template
$EDITOR new-issue.yaml
jiracli create --from-draft new-issue.yaml   # preview with validation
jiracli create --from-draft new-issue.yaml --yes
```

### Deleting

```sh
jiracli delete comment  PROJ-123:comment:9421 --yes
jiracli delete attachment PROJ-123:attach:10042 --yes
jiracli delete link     10234 --yes
jiracli delete issue    PROJ-123 --yes
```

### Opening in browser

```sh
jiracli open PROJ-123
jiracli open PROJ-123 --print-url    # just the URL, don't open
```

## Output modes

| Mode | When | Format |
|---|---|---|
| Plain text | default | Human-readable, `[exit:0 \| Xms]` footer |
| NDJSON | `--json` | One JSON object per line, no footer, stable v1 schema |

Large outputs (>200 lines or >50 KB) are automatically written to `<tmpdir>/jiracli-output/output-N.txt` with exploration hints inline (`<tmpdir>` is the OS temp dir — `/tmp` on Linux, `$TMPDIR` on macOS; the hint always shows the real resolved path). `--json` is never truncated.

NDJSON schema reference: [`docs/json-schema.md`](docs/json-schema.md)

---

## Lookup

Before writing, use `lookup` to find valid names and IDs:

```sh
jiracli lookup users      "alex"  --project PROJ    # who can be assigned
jiracli lookup components         --project PROJ    # valid component names
jiracli lookup versions           --project PROJ --unreleased
jiracli lookup priorities         --project PROJ
jiracli lookup link-types                           # Blocks, Duplicates, etc.
jiracli lookup statuses   --query "In"
jiracli lookup issue-types        --project PROJ
jiracli lookup fields     "story"                   # find custom field IDs
jiracli lookup projects   "PROJ"
jiracli lookup labels     "regr"  --project PROJ
```

Metadata is cached at `~/.cache/jiracli/<profile>/` (5 min for labels, 1 h for components/versions, 24 h for everything else). Invalidate with `jiracli cache clear` or bypass with `--no-cache`.

## Multiple profiles
```sh
jiracli auth login --profile staging --url https://jira-staging.example.com
jiracli show PROJ-123 --profile staging
jiracli auth profile staging          # set as default
jiracli auth profile --list
```
